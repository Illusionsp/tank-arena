## üéØ Goal
Build a **modular game engine** that handles rendering, physics, player control, and maze navigation while experimenting with:  

-  **Real-time multiplayer synchronization**  
-  **AI behavior** using C++ (compiled to WebAssembly) to navigate mazes and engage the player  
-  **Efficient canvas-based rendering** for dynamic mazes and obstacles  
-  **Maze mechanics**: procedurally generated or predefined maps with walls, paths, and exit points

##  Current Status
- Currently setting up the **core game engine**
